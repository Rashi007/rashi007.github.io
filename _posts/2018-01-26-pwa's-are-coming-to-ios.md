PWA or Progressive web apps are web apps that help provide an app like experience to users. PWA requires modern web capabilities but can be built using vanillaJS, React, Polymer, Angular or any other framework.

A PWA brings best of both worlds as there is low friction to reach to users fingertips as it basically a web page but the experience is like an app which is immersive and with offline support. They work on every browser and and responsive to fit to varied screen sizes, maintaining an amazing user experience.

With use the loading of PWA becomes very fast on slow network connections due to [Service Worker](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/service-worker/introduction/). We can send relevant [Push Notifications](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/engage-and-retain/push-notifications/) and have an icon on the user’s home-screen that can load the web app as full-screen app experience.

According to Google web fundamentals, A Progressive Web App is:
* **Progressive** — Works for every user, regardless of browser choice because it’s built with progressive enhancement as a core tenet.
* **Responsive** — Fits any form factor: desktop, mobile, tablet, or whatever is next.
* **Connectivity independent** — Enhanced with service workers to work offline or on low-quality networks.
* **App-like** — Feels like an app, because the app shell model separates the application functionalityfrom application content .
* **Fresh** — Always up-to-date thanks to the service worker update process.
* **Safe** — Served via HTTPS to prevent snooping and to ensure content hasn’t been tampered with.
* **Discoverable** — Is identifiable as an “application” thanks to W3C manifest and service worker registration scope, allowing search engines to find it.
* **Re-engageable** — Makes re-engagement easy through features like push notifications.
* **Installable** — Allows users to add apps they find most useful to their home screen without the hassle of an app store.
* **Linkable** — Easily share the application via URL, does not require complex installation.
